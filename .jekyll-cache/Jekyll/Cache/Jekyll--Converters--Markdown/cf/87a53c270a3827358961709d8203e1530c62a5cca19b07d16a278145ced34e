I"…<p>The Romanian Baccalaureate is the final exam that a student must pass in order to graduate high school. Despite being an important news topic each year, there is no in-depth analysis of the results in the media. Most of the time, we only see the national pass rate and a per-county map. Therefore, I decided to write an article with figures to give some insights about the subject.</p>
