I"®<p>The Romanian Baccalaureate is the final exam that a student must pass in order to graduate high school. Despite being an important news topic each year, there is no in-depth analysis of the results in the media. Most of the time, we only see the total pass rate and a per-county map. Therefore, I decided to write a data visualization project to give some insights about the subject. The data is provided by the <a href="https://data.gov.ro/">Governmentâ€™s dataset website</a>.
The figures are interactive, hover over them to get more information. Note that I will use Romanian language for figures since it would be confusing to translate terms such as <em>profilul uman</em>.</p>
